        <p>Dear Sir/Madam, 
            <br />
            Namaste. I hope you all are in a happy & cheerful mood with sound health. We both are OK. Once again, locked 24x at home due to heavy rains in Mumbai. 
            <br />           
            In the second fortnight of June 2022, my Hyderabad friend Mr. N Sreekumar of Prayas released a discussion paper on "Electricity Safety: Tragically failing through the Governing gaps". I had an opportunity to discuss with him, this vital topic & also attend the wonderful webinar by Mr. Sreekumar, in the last fortnight.  The webinar was attended by over 250 professionals, from all over the country.  
            <br />                        
            I sincerely feel that it is an important topic, being neglected by many of us. Almost 15.000 Fatal accidents (leading to human death) occurred in 2020. (Every 30 Mins one person dies because of an Electric Accident, is a serious issue). Almost one person/year out of one lakh population dies in my country due to Electrical accidents (as against 0.05 persons in the US/UK). The most horrifying thing is the numbers are on an increasing trend in my country.   
            <br />                         
            Even with all developments (computerization) which we have achieved, there is no serious thought being given to authentic data collection: How many lives we lost in Electricity Accidents in a year.
            <br />                         
            I think we all need to come together & think very seriously about it.  
            <br />
            A life lost means a family affected. Think how many difficulties the families might have faced in case they would have lost bread earners for their homes
            <br />                        
            Only a financial compensation (of Rs  4 Lakhs/life) will not solve the problem.
            <br />
            We all stakeholders need to put in all our efforts, to reduce Fatal Electrical Accidents in India.  
            <br />                           
            So I sincerely thought that I need to contribute my squirrel's share by bringing to your notice, the Prayas Report & that the number of fatal Electricity accidents is on a rising trend in India. 
            <br />                        
            Based on Prayas Report, I have tried to make a PPT for you. I know you all are busy. But I sincerely request you to go through the PPT at your convenience. You may forward your comments/queries to me. 
            <br />                        
            Finally, kindly excuse me in case there are any mistakes in my understanding of the issues. The idea is not to criticize/ hurt anybody but to present the situation, as understood by a student like me.  I sincerely respect all your views. 
            <br />                        
            In case you need any help/assistance on any other related PS topic, kindly do inform me. 
            <br />                        
            With Highest Affectionate Regards; 
            <br />                       
            Vijay
