        <p>
        I am very happy to share with you the fortnightly  "Akshay Prakash Issue (3 of 2022)", covering News items & views/analyses in connection with "Russia's Invasion on Ukraine; Its impact on Ukraine's/ European  Power sector" for your kind perusal.  I propose to update you on this issue every fortnight. 
        <br />
        You might have noted that I have drastically reduced the number of recipients, as I feel many of my friends are very busy & hence may not get time, because of their tight schedules.  I have the highest respect for their opinion, but  I will continue my effort, as it's my hobby & send it to a smaller group of the interested. 
        <br />
        I am 100% free these days.  No active work at all. In case you have some issues/topics on which I can get info, study  & prepare a PPT so that it can be of some help to you, kindly inform me. 
        <br />
        I will try to bring the issue Power News Click-3,  by 7th April 2022, which will cover National news in the power sector in March 2022 & some Regulatory judgments by the Supreme Court/High Courts on interesting topics, as I am also studying such issues, these days.  
        <br />
        I am sincerely thankful to you all for your constant support & encouragements. 
        <br />
        With Highest affectionate  Regards;  
        <br />
        Vijay
