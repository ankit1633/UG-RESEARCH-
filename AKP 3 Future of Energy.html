        <title>AKP 3 / 2021: “Special issue on Microgrids: Future of Energy ” </title>
    </head>

        <p>
        I am enclosing herewith Akshay Prakash Issue No. 3 of 2021 on "Microgrids". Incidentally, all developed countries are taking steps in installing Microgrids. In India TATA Power has also recently announced its proposal of commissioning 10,000 Microgrids.
        <br />
I was thrilled to read the news that, on 19th Nov 2021, the US Govt has proposed 30% tax concessions on the development of Microgrids. Microgrids is a wonderful solution particularly for our critical installations: Airports, Railway Junctions, Hospitals & IND areas & SEZs. 
<br />
I am a "Student Member" of a Global Microgrid study group". I get regular Info/ Reports/ Papers about Microgrids, from Microgrid Knowledge Organization, which I study. Hence I propose to  update the PPT on Microgrids, every  3/4 months.
