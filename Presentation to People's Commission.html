        Very Good evening Sushama Tai.
        <br />
        I delivered 2 lectures on "Sustainability In Power systems" to VIVA COET staff on Monday & Tuesday morning (2 hours each). It was a good interactive session with staff members. 
        <br />
        Today evening as directed by Hon Raja Sir (Former Chairman MERC), I made a presentation to the Peoples' Commission (constituted by retired IAS officers, Retired CEOs from various organizations) on Proposed Amendments to Electricity Act 2003, which may be tabled in the Parliament, during oncoming Monsoon Session. The Audience was in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkatta, and many places in India  & some very in the US. It was a gathering of about 40 seniors, above 65 years. They wanted to understand the undercurrents in the proposal so that they will meet the MPs & leaders of various political parties & discuss with them the pros & cons of the Bill 
        <br />
        In today's evening session I made a presentation, for 30 mins, which was appreciated by all seniors. I made their fundamentals very clear in 90 Min Q/A session. The important thing is I also enjoyed the session though basically, the issue was legal. 
        <br />
        I am enclosing the PPT for your kind reference. The issue is legal but I made interesting by adding Tech flavour. You may kindly go through it at your convenience. 
        <br />
        We both are Good. 
        <br />
        With Highest affectionate Regards, 
        <br />
        Vijay
