        <p>Dear Sir/Madam,<br /> 
            Namskar <br />
            Hope this email finds you in a happy and cheerful mood.  
            <br />                   
            MOP has issued a PPT on Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022 in the 1st Week of July 2022. 
            <br />
            As directed by Hon V P Raja Sir (Former Chairman MERC), I made a presentation to the Peoples Commission (constituted by retired Professionals, IAS officers, Retired CEOs, and Consumer Organizations) on the "Proposed Amendments to Electricity Act 2003", based on PPT issued by MOP. The Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022 may be tabled in Parliament, during oncoming Monsoon Session. 
            <br />             
            It was a gathering of about 25 seniors, above 65 years. They wanted to understand the undercurrents in the proposal so that they will be able to meet various leaders & discuss with them the pros & cons of the Bill.  We had a two-hour-long interesting Session, during which we had interesting discussions.
            <br />
            I am enclosing the PPT for your kind reference. . You may kindly go through it at your convenience.  
            <br />
            Kindly note that these are my views. You may kindly excuse me if you feel my views are wrong. 
            <br />                   
            I know you are busy but since the proposed Amendments  will have an immense impact on the Power Sector, inclusive of consumers, I will be happy to have your kind responses, at your convenience  
            <br />                        
            We both are OK 
            <br />
            With Highest affectionate Regards, 
            <br />
            Vijay
