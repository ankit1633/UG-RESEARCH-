        <p>Namaskar.<br />Hope this mail finds you in a happy & cheerful mood with sound health, by God's Grace. We both are keeping good health. Hope I am not disturbing you in your busy schedule <br />As promised, the PPT on "Challenges in "Solar Parks" Schemes is enclosed therewith, as the first issue of AKSHAY PRAKASH, our new fortnightly I request you to kindly go through it as per your convenience. I sincerely welcome your queries, if any, on this topic. This is an effort to put all available info under one PPT. It's only the collection from various websites/reports, which I could go through.<br />A line of appreciation, from sector experts like you, will work as an immunity booster for me.<br />If found interesting, you may kindly circulate it to your friends, colleagues & students. No issues at all.<br/>You may inform me, their email addresses so that I will include them in the mailing list for Akashya Prakash issues. It's a very small effort to help the needy.</p>
