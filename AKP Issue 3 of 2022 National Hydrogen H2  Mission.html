        And it happened again on Sunday morning. South Mumbai's Power system was interrupted for over an hour. I read some details in newspapers & am collecting some info from my friends. I am preparing a small PPT on this issue. 
        <br />
        GOM has announced to hold the inquiry in this matter. Some expert friends criticized Govt's decision. But I sincerely feel that as our Power system is very dynamic & we must critically analyze all such events. All recommendations of such committees may not have been completed. But, we can at least know why it happened & be careful in future. You will agree with me that in every such event we might have lost millions of Rupees of production, because of the failure of the Power system. So it's worth it to study & be informed. 
        <br />
        I am sincerely thankful to you all for your constant support & encouragement. 
        <br />
        With Highest affectionate  Regards;
